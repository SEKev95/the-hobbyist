I originally was thinking of setting up a platform/website for hobbyists where they can show out their collections. I wanted to make something like this because as a hobbyist there isnâ€™t a place where I can show my collection and get some recognition for it. Coupled with a forum and a person profile, users will be able to sign in/ login for a better experience. Users will also be given the option of being able to sell single or multiple pieces of their collection.
